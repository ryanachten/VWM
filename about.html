      <h2>About VWM</h2>
      <p><span id="vwm-logotype">Visual Working Memory</span> is a test designed to measure individual differences in working memory. Working memory is the ability to remember information for long enough to use it. This is a core function of our complex information processing system.<p>
      <p>This test has been created with the purpose of furthering neuropsychological assessment, investigations into working memory, and research into aspects of our cognitive architecture.</p>
      <p>VWM requires you to remember an increasing amount of visual information, while reporting what you saw in previous scenes. As you progress through the different stages, the increasing difficulty will reflect how working memory is affected by having to hold onto an extra image.<p>
      <p>Currently, a pilot study is being conducted to assess the validity and reliability of this new test. Results from the study will guide future endeavours. If you wish to know more or want to participate in future research you can contact us below:</p>
