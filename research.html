      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Most tests of working memory measure the number of items that can be remembered, either in the face of interference from external stimuli, or while carrying out a concurrent processing task. To counter the effects of external interference relies on one's ability to focus perceptual attention (Chun, Golomb, &amp; Turk-Browne, 2011).</p>
      <p>The difficulty of a concurrent task limits how well the task measures working memory (Turner &amp; Engle, 1989). This perceived difficulty will be different for everyone, dependant on, for example, reading, or arithmetic ability, or ability to block interference from external stimuli.</p>
      <p>The source of individual differences in working memory, proposed by Cowan (2008) is the control and scope of executive, or internally oriented attention. This executive attention, sometimes also called conscious awareness, parallels the functioning of the episodic buffer in the multicomponent theory (Baddeley, 2012). A standardised measure of this has not yet been devised (Dehn, 2015, p. 6).</p>
      <p>The n-back paradigm allows for an increase in executive attention demands, while keeping the demands of perceptual attention relatively constant across trials. Many n-back tasks, however, are time-limited, and rapid information processing speed is required for accurate responding (Miller et al., 2009).</p>
      <p>Allen, Baddeley and Hitch propose that accurate recall of a previously seen visual stimulus is dependent on the availability and attribution of executive attention (2014). This is what we aim to measure with the VWM task, free from confounds caused by experience with certain operations, individual differences in perceptual attention, or information processing speed.</p>
      <p>Performance in the VWM relies on all the processes described by Redick & Lindsey that are involved in working memory: encoding, maintenance, recall, recognition, familiarity, updating, temporal ordering, binding, attention, and inhibition (2013, p.1110).</p>
